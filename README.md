# ForexArbitrage (CSE 2353 Final Project)
This project serves as a proof of concept for an automated Forex Arbitrage machine.
The project takes an input of a series of csv files in a directory which represent a currency matrix and following prompt to the user for a starting account balance, outputs an ending balance and a ROI for a series of Arbitrages done on the data. 
The program utilizes recursive backtracking to identify the chain of transactions which results in the highest return for each currency matrix and proceeds to simulate the execution of each of those matrices once.

###Setup
As a precondition, ensure that your system has C++ and is able to execute CLion files. To check this type:
```
cmake --version
```
Next, you need to download the repository from Github. This can be done by entering:
```
git clone https://github.com/saakethkoka/ForexArbitrage.git
```
Following this, you will need to run the program. 
```
cd ForexArbitrage
mkdir executable
cd executable
cmake3 ..
make
./a.out excelFile.csv
```
